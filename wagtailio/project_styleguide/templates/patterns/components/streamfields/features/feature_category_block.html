{% load wagtailcore_tags %}

<div>
    <h3>{{ value.heading }}</h3>
    {% comment %}
    The line below could have been written (for better readability) as

        {% for feature in value.features with value=feature %}

    However, this would break django-pattern library due to a limitation:
    https://github.com/torchbox/django-pattern-library/issues/138
    {% endcomment %}
    {% for value in value.features %}
        {% include_block value %}
    {% endfor %}
</div>
